It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything\r\n>>else vanish.\"\r\n_-Neal Stephenson, \"In the Beginning was the Command\r\nLine\"_\r\n\r\n>>\"Show me your ~/.emacs and I will tell you who you are.\"\r\n_-Bogdan Maryniuk_\r\n\r\n>>\"Emacs is like a laser guided missile. It only has to be slightly\r\n>>mis-configured to ruin your whole day.\"\r\n_-Sean McGrathi_\r\n\r\n>>\"While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your\r\n>>soul.\"\r\n_-Per Abrahamseni_\r\n\r\n>>\"Lisp isn't a language, it's a building material.\"\r\n_- Alan Kay_\r\n\r\n>>\"The reasonable man adapts himself to Emacs; the unreasonable one\r\n>>persists in trying to adapt Emacs to himself.

Shaw_\r\n\r\n>> \"Compared to Emacs Wizards, graphical-IDE users are the equivalent\r\n>>of amateur musicians, pawing at their instrument with a sort of\r\n>>desperation.

Built around a few principals\r\nthat probably don't apply to many people other then me\r\n\r\n- I don't really like the emacs key scheme.\r\n- I love modal editing\r\n- I hate vim\r\n- I love lisp, and any reason to use it\r\n- I like my editor to do a lot of work for me, and I like hacking on\r\n  it\r\n\r\nEvil mode is the best vim implementation that I know about that isn't\r\nvim. Emacs is a much better platform then vim. That is why this configuration\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nAlso, line numbers are overrated. No linum mode.\r\n\r\nOrganization\r\n------------\r\n\r\n`init.el` does as little as possible. Configuration is done in `init/init-*`,\r\nand is as modular as possible (so that when something goes wrong, you can\r\ncomment out modules).\r\n\r\nPackage management is done by `quelpa`, which will use MELPA when possible\r\nto build emacs packages. I think it is a step up from `el-get`, and find it\r\nto be much more stable. `quelpa` will bootstrap itself and all packages when\r\nemacs loads.\r\n\r\nMy crazy mappings are mostly in `init-keymaps`, and are inspired by all the\r\ndifferent editors I have used before. Both vim and emacs use different\r\nphilosophies to have all key mappings available at all times. I prefer instead\r\nto have the things I use frequently quickly available, even if it means not\r\nhaving the things I don't use easily available in a standard location.\r\n\r\nDependancies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nosx:\r\n\r\n`brew install ctags node`\r\n\r\nIf ctags isn't pointing at the right version\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\non ubuntu run\r\n\r\n`sudo update-alternatives --config ctags`\r\n\r\nand choose `ctags-exuberant`\r\n\r\non osx lion do\r\n\r\n`sudo mv /usr/bin/ctags /usr/bin/ctags-old`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
