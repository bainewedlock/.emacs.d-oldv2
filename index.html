<blockquote>
<p>"Emacs outshines all other editing
software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the
stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything
else vanish."
<em>-Neal Stephenson, "In the Beginning was the Command
Line"</em></p>

<p>"Show me your ~/.emacs and I will tell you who you are."
<em>-Bogdan Maryniuk</em></p>

<p>"Emacs is like a laser guided missile. It only has to be slightly
mis-configured to ruin your whole day."
<em>-Sean McGrathi</em></p>

<p>"While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your
soul."
<em>-Per Abrahamseni</em></p>

<p>"Lisp isn't a language, it's a building material."
<em>- Alan Kay</em></p>

<p>"The reasonable man adapts himself to Emacs; the unreasonable one
persists in trying to adapt Emacs to himself. Therefore all progress
depends on the unreasonable man."
<em>- G.B. Shaw</em></p>

<p>"Compared to Emacs Wizards, graphical-IDE users are the equivalent
of amateur musicians, pawing at their instrument with a sort of
desperation. An IDE has blinking lights and pretty dialogs that you
can't interact with properly, and gives newbies a nice comfortable
sense of control. But that control is extremely crude, and all serious
programmers prefer something that gives them more power."
<em>- Steve Yegge</em></p>

<h2>
<a name="philosophy" class="anchor" href="#philosophy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Philosophy</h2>

<p>New iteration of my emacs configuration. Built around a few principals
that probably don't apply to many people other then me</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't really like the emacs key scheme.</li>
<li>I love modal editing</li>
<li>I hate vim</li>
<li>I love lisp, and any reason to use it</li>
<li>I like my editor to do a lot of work for me, and I like hacking on
it</li>
</ul><p>Evil mode is the best vim implementation that I know about that isn't
vim. Emacs is a much better platform then vim. That is why this configuration
exists.</p>

<p>Also, line numbers are overrated. No linum mode.</p>

<h2>
<a name="organization" class="anchor" href="#organization"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organization</h2>

<p><code>init.el</code> does as little as possible. Configuration is done in <code>init/init-*</code>,
and is as modular as possible (so that when something goes wrong, you can
comment out modules).</p>

<p>Package management is done by <code>quelpa</code>, which will use MELPA when possible
to build emacs packages. I think it is a step up from <code>el-get</code>, and find it
to be much more stable. <code>quelpa</code> will bootstrap itself and all packages when
emacs loads.</p>

<p>My crazy mappings are mostly in <code>init-keymaps</code>, and are inspired by all the
different editors I have used before. Both vim and emacs use different
philosophies to have all key mappings available at all times. I prefer instead
to have the things I use frequently quickly available, even if it means not
having the things I don't use easily available in a standard location.</p>

<p>on ubuntu run</p>

<p>and choose <code>ctags-exuberant</code></p>
